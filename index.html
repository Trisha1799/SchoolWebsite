			<p class="text-muted text-left">Quaint little restaurant tucked inside a by-lane of Juhu. Blink and you will miss the entrance to the cafe. So be alert enough to spot the black signboard that says "Prithvi cafe" while you are on the main road. The restaurant has a reasonably good menu at reasonable prices. The food is delicious, the servings are quite large and some dishes can be shared by 2 people. Attracts quite a trendy crowd of aspiring celebrities on show days. Be sure to book in advance to avoid disappointments. On other days, the crowd there is pretty hep and happening. Hosts the famous "Prithvi theater fest", which you must attend if possible.</p>

It is a beautifully maintained small complex with yellow painted walls. It's a historical site famous among tourists. It contains a number of different devices that were used to measure time in different eras in the Indian history. It has a nominal ticket price of ₹15 for Indians but about ₹225-250 for foreigners. Nice place to visit. We had an incredible experience visiting this observatory and seeing the accuracy of the astronomical instruments built around 300 years ago</p>

				<p>I loved the movie a lot 
As I am a great fan of marvel
Avengers: Endgame', which marks the end of the Infinity Saga, is spellbinding and surely an enthralling experience. The last film of the 'Avengers' franchise is remarkable and doesn't disappoint. Watching all our favorite superheroes in one film is just surpassing. Marvel has been working on this grand culmination ever since they released 'Iron Man'. I'm damn sure that all of their hard work and ambition has paid off. The directors, Anthony and Joe Russo have made sure that it delivers an unforgettable experience. Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely have come up with a screenplay full of epic and unpredictable moments. The film has a great balance of humor, emotions, and action. The biggest strength of the film is the emotions. This is the most emotional superhero film I have ever seen. It's just perfect. The action sequences were jaw-dropping. The climactic battle left me amazed. It's just filled with memorable moments and cannot be described with words. The visuals are gorgeous and have a great impact on the film. The humor doesn't look exaggerated and manages to entertain throughout the film. The plot twists were very impressive and suspenseful. The film features many cameos of characters from the previous MCU films, which just gives a double dose of excitement. The background score gives me goosebumps, though I've listened to it several times. It was really clever to make changes to the characterization of the Hulk. I enjoyed that a lot. But the show-stealer is Robert Downey Jr, who plays the role of Tony Stark/Iron Man. The man who started it all proves yet again that there's no one else who can perfect his role. Do not miss his powerful moments in the final battle.</p>

				<p>HAKUNA MATATA.... I really loved this song... 
I haven’t had the fortune of watching the 1994 original The Lion King or the 2012 3D re-release in theaters, but I still remember watching the it on Television after it was digitally re-mastered. From then on, it has been on my top favourite list. I have watched the movie again and again and still cherish the experience. 

Jon Favreau’s The Jungle Book (2016) was an absolute treat! And the moment I came to know about him taking on The Lion King, I was super excited. Jon Favreau’s vision regarding this film has been very clear from the beginning. He wanted to take his Photo-realistic CGI technology he used in The Jungle Book to the next level making his  film look almost as real as a BBC/Discovery Nature Documentary, and he has made it happen. Visually, The Lion King is a majestic and breathtaking experience. If a person isn’t aware of the technology used in the film, s/he will completely be convinced of the film being live action and the characters and scenarios being real. The hard-work of Favreau and the Visual effects team has paid off well. They deserve a standing ovation for this. 

Does the realism of the characters feel as a compromise on the facial expressions and stunts like we had in the animated one? Well, it does. In the traditionally animated movie, animals could be made to give human like profound expressions and perform actions and stunts which isn’t seen in real life. And this film has focused on realism as the defining factor. Thus, making animals show those facial expressions, dance around and perform stunts like they did in animated classic isn’t possible.

Coming to the  story, it has been more or less the same. Some liberation have been taken, there are some scenes removed and some new scenes added. Even a few characters have been modified. While some changes are welcomed, there are a few aspects that I wish were kept same like original.

The background score and music by Hans Zimmer is an upgrade on the original which stays grounded to the soul of the original and further builds upon it. Certain renditions felt even more intense and impactful. Songs composed by Tim Rice and Elton John are more or less the same like the original and Beyonce has done a great job, her rendition of new song Spirit is a soulful piece. Be prepared has been cut short and re-written, but feels adequate according to the film’s situation and script changes.
Overall ,it is a fun and entertaining movie which should definitely be experienced at theaters.. </p>

				<p>HOLY!  WOW!  WHAT AN ADVENTURE!  I loved how the story focused on bringing others together then blowing things up.  I loved how the story was set in Autumn.  Autumn is the season that most people aren’t interested in.  When people watch this movie people will realize that Autumn is festive if we just see it from a different perspective.  I also loved how the native people who lived in the forest rely upon and trust nature.  That is the way we are supposed to view nature.  This movie is connecting to the four great natural resources that we use on our planet - Air, Fire, Water, and Earth.  That is so environmentalist!  Without these resources, we wouldn't exist!  My favorite characters are Elsa and Anna.  I really loved Elsa and Anna's character because these girls are worthy of taking risks on their own just like men do.  Also, their mother had these two daughters for a very important reason.  Elsa performed by Idina Menzel is the perfect mythic and larger than life character.  Grateful her kingdom now accepts her, she works hard to be a good queen. But deep down she can’t help but wonder why she was born with powers.  When Elsa hears a voice that only she can hear it made me think it’s something important.  Like maybe something she has forgotten or maybe something she's supposed to know.  At the end of the movie, she realizes who she really is.  That's why the creators made her hair white.  Elsa was born with white hair and she couldn't change it.  She finds out what her hair means.  Something even more than having her power.  As for Anna, I really loved her character too.  Anna performed by Kristen Bell is the perfect fairytale character - unflappable, she is the forever optimist.  Anna is fine as long as she has her family, Arendelle is safe, and she never has to be alone again.  As Anna journeys with Elsa to the enchanted forests beyond Arendelle, along with Kristoff, Olaf and Sven, she wonders if they can ever return to the happiness they once knew.  I also enjoyed Kristoff's performance by Jonathan Groff.  Kristoff doesn’t hesitate to be there for Anna and Elsa as they journey into mysterious lands that even this well-traveled iceman has never seen.   I also was very amused by Olaf's performance by Josh Gad.   Having learned to read, he’s absolutely fascinated with the various wonders of life.  With his new curiosity for knowledge, Olaf is a source of hope in dark times.  Olaf also states a very deep sentiment in this movie and that is, "Water has memory."  That has a so deep meaning!  Olaf also learns in this movie that there are some conflicts in life.  And I also really enjoyed Sven's character.  Although Kristoff now has the love of his life with Anna, he still finds himself leaning on Sven as a best friend and a confidante and mentor, especially as Kristoff’s attempts to propose to Anna go awry.  Sven tries his best to help out his best friend and makes sure that he guides down the right path.   Also what I really loved about this movie is that all of the cast members who were in this movie sounded like angels!  When looking at the music score, my favorite song was, “Show Yourself."  The message is that if you follow your dreams, you will see who you are and you will become who you were born to be.  This movie is filled with generosity, integrity, optimism, cooperation, tolerance, and above all, spirituality.  Thank you so much Walt Disney Animated Studios for the astounding movie!  Please keep making more films that focus on heartfelt messages which bring people together by accepting differences and hearing stories that go unnoticed.</p>
